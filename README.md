# movies_analysis
Movies Analysis Project using Jupyter Notebook

Background: We’re going to pretend we are analysts working for the
film industry and are going to analyse a series of movie titles and
associated data from IMDB.

Objective: Explore and analyse the datasets provided to generate a set
of insights driven by a few questions posed by our clients. (See
questions below).

Expected Outcome: 
1. Run SQL queries that answer (a DB in SQLite
could be an option) the questions posed and 

2. create a set of data visualisations that tell a story about the insights requested.
Software: Excel (optional), SQL (SQLite suffices) and Tableau and/or
Power BI. You can also use R and / or Python (highly optional). 
Data:.csv files provided via slack (see side relation diagram)
Output: 1. SQL queries that answer the questions posed and 2. A data
visualisation / dashboard you can use for your own portfolio - feel free
to expand on it too!


Q01. Produce a table with the number of movies released, average running time, average ratings and total number of votes by year from 1990 to 2000 only.
